# Data
You need to download the data from the ADNI website.

# Data Preprocess
The ADNI data is preprocessed by the following steps. 
- Step 1: run read_data_1.R
- Step 2: run read_data_2.R
  
Then, you will obtain the data that can be used by BroadcasTR and TLR-rescaled. 

# Run methods
- BroadcasTR: RealNonLinear_ADNI.R
- TLR-rescaled: RealLinear_ADNI.R

# The important region
- boxplot.R
