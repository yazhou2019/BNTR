# Data
- You need to put the fitting results and ise of (BroadcasTR, TLR-rescaled, TLR-rescaled) in SimResults. Those .Rdata files can be obtain by using the codes of Table 1. 
- You need to put the fitting results and ise of TLR in TLR. Those .Rdata files can be obtain by using the codes of Table_1_new. 

# Region selection of TLR, TLR-rescaled, ENetR, and BroadcasTR for n = 1000
- Run 20230224_plot_true.R, you will get the plot results;
- As for the color bar, you can run plot_color_bar.R and use zoom botton to adjust an appropriate size.
