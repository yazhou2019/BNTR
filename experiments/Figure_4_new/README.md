# Data
- You need to put the fitting results and ise of (BroadcasTR, TLR-rescaled, TLR-rescaled) in SimResults. Those .Rdata files can be obtain by using the codes of Table_1_new. 
- You need to put the fitting results and ise of TLR in TLR. Those .Rdata files can be obtain by using the codes of Table_1_new. 

# Region selection of TLR, TLR-rescaled, ENetR, and BroadcasTR for n = 1000
- Run 20230918_plot_true.R, you will get the plot results; the dependence can be founded in "/experiments/Table_1_new". You can relace the following code in 20230918_plot_true.R
```
setwd("~/Desktop/Research/JRSSB/换editor上传/Table_1/BroadcasTR")
```
to 
```
setwd("./Table_1_new/BroadcasTR")
```
- As for the color bar, you can run plot_color_bar.R and use zoom botton to adjust an appropriate size.
