# Data
- We compare 4 methods in the main paper. The code are collected in this directory.
- The synthetic data is generated by "./BroadcasTR/20230918_generate_data_new_editor.R." You will obtain the synthetic data "Simul_n1000_rep50_final_fix_new_editor.Rdata", which is saved in /SimResults. 
- When you run methods (BroadcasTR, TLR-rescaled, ENetR), you need to put the generated data in the local file named "./BroadcasTR/SimResults".


# BroadcasTR
- See the file BroadcasTR. You can run SimNonLin.R and ISE_SimNonLin.R to obtain the fitting results and ISE, respectively.

# TLR-rescaled
- See the file TLR-rescaled. You can run SimLin.R and ISE_SimLin.R to obtain the fitting results and ISE, respectively.

# ENetR
- See the file ENetR. You can run SimENetR.R and ISE_SimENetR.R to obtain the fitting results and ISE, respectively.

# TLR1 (The code depends on the MATLAB code in https://hua-zhou.github.io/TensorReg/)
- step 1: use Data_generation_to_MATLAB_new.R to transform the generated Rdata to .mat format.
- step 2: run (TLR_repeat_1000_grid.m, TLR_repeat_750_grid.m, TLR_repeat_500_grid.m) in MATLAB to obtain the fitting results.
- step 3: use mat2Rdata.R to transform the fitting results to .Rdata format.
- step 4: use parallel_get_ise_TLR1.R to obtain the ISE.
