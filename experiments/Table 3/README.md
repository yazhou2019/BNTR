# Data
- The real data is preprocessed by the file in ./RealDataSim/get_real_sim_data0521.R.

# TLR1
- The code depends on the MATLAB code in https://hua-zhou.github.io/TensorReg/
- The real data in .Rdata format need to be transformed to the .mat format; see ./experiments/Table 1/TLR1/Data_generation_to_MATLAB_new.R


# BroadcasTR, TLR-rescaled, ENetR
- See RealNonLin_repro_K11_tuning.R, RealLinear.R, and RealENet.R, respectively
